# Basic Language Translation App Using Groq API and Langserve



This repository demonstrates how to build and deploy a very basic language translation application  using Groq API and Langserve for model serving and API deployment.


 

## Features
Translate text between multiple languages using Groq API.

Integrate Langserve for easy API deployment.

Easily deploy as a microservice for language conversion

Flexible Configuration: Easily swap out or add more language models, including specialized Groq API models.

###  Prerequisites
Python 3.8+

Groq API account and credentials : 

Groq API offers high-performance access to machine learning models. In this project, it is utilized to perform language translation between various language pairs.

Langserve for API deployment

Langserve is a framework for deploying language models as APIs. It enables fast and easy API deployment with minimal configuration. The Langserve API can handle translation requests in real-time, making it easy to integrate into web and mobile applications.
